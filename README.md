# The Hub Backend

## Overview

This repository contains the backend codebase for The Hub, a community-focused web application designed to manage user authentication, tasks, events, and communications. The backend provides APIs to support the frontend application, handling data storage, user management, and business logic. It is built with a focus on scalability and maintainability.

## Repository

- **URL**: https://github.com/WBS-Bootcamp-Repos/the-hub-backend.git

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Node.js with Express
- **Language**: JavaScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Project Structure

- `controllers/`: Handles request logic and responses for API endpoints.
- `db/`: Database connection and configuration (e.g., `connection.js`).
- `middleware/`: Middleware functions for authentication (`auth.js`) and error handling (`errorHandler.js`).
- `models/`: Data models for the application.
- `routes/`: API route definitions.
- `schemas/`: Data validation schemas.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers.
- `index.js`: Entry point for the application.
- `.env`: Environment variables for configuration (e.g., database URI, JWT secret).

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/WBS-Bootcamp-Repos/the-hub-backend.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd the-hub-backend
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the required environment variables (e.g., database URI, port).
5. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
6. The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` (or the specified port).

## Development Guidelines

- Follow RESTful API design principles for route and controller implementation.
- Use middleware for authentication and error handling to ensure secure and robust endpoints.
- Write clear, modular code and adhere to linting and formatting standards.
- Test endpoints thoroughly before deployment.
